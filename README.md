# TheWall
A social media website built with PHP and MySQL, complete with user registration and posts



The Wall is a simple social media web application where users can create accounts, view the wall of everyone’s posts, and add their own posts. They can also modify and delete any of their previous posts.


The first page index.php includes a login prompt and links to register if you are a new user.

The register page has a simple 3 field form to create a user account.
The user can then access the wall through the link “The Wall” in the nav bar.
